# "EsportsOS" (Working Title)
EsportsOS is designed to allow all sizes of esports tournaments to be organised in a few simple clicks, with the ability to record match results and rank teams/players based on their performances. EsportsOS also gives admins the ability to create several dashboards that can be used within livestreams/broadcasts to be shared data with viewers and attendees.

### External API

Most data stored in the database tables will be accessible through an external API, meaning other processes/applications can request data. The &quot;EOS-API&quot; will accept all GET requests for matches, teams and players – but not return any personal data such as full names or passwords etc.

All GET Requests can be accessed using the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Request Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /api/status | GET | Returns the overall status of the system. |
| /api/teams | GET | Returns an array of all teams and their data. |
| /api/teams/{{team\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific team. |
| /api/matchups | GET | Returns an array of all matches and their data. |
| /api/matchups/{{matchup\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific match. |
| /api/players | GET | Returns an array of all players and their data – but not their personal data. |
| /api/players/{{player\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific player – but not their personal data. |


### Reusable Components

I have created a variety of reusable Laravel Components that can be used across the entire application. See the list below for more details:

ALERT - a simple way to create a popup alert to give a small piece of information.
Usage:
* ```<x-alert message="<<Your Alert Message>>" type="<<Bootstrap alert type e.g. danger>>" dismiss="<<If the alert can be dismissed e.g. 1 or 0>>"></x-alert>```
