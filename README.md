### External API

Most data stored in the database tables will be accessible through an external API, meaning other processes/applications can request data. The &quot;EOS-API&quot; will accept all GET requests for matches, teams and players – but not return any personal data such as full names or passwords etc.

All GET Requests can be accessed using the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Request Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /api/status | GET | Returns the overall status of the system. |
| /api/teams | GET | Returns an array of all teams and their data. |
| /api/teams/{{team\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific team. |
| /api/matches | GET | Returns an array of all matches and their data. |
| /api/matches/{{match\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific match. |
| /api/players | GET | Returns an array of all players and their data – but not their personal data. |
| /api/players/{{player\_id}} | GET | Returns details for a specific player – but not their personal data. |
